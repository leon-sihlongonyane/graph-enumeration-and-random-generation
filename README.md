# graph-enumeration-and-random-generation
MSc Project: Enumeration and Uniform Generation of Directed Acyclic Graphs. Modification of Robinson's recurence formula to counting by 1 sink and 1 source; Further modify and obtain unknown counting sequences.
- Computing values of the counting sequence for acyclic digraphs.
- Modification of this counting sequence by adding -1; hence counting sinks only
- Adding weight k(-1)^k on the above results to counting sequence for 1 sink and 1 source.
- Considering subtracting binomial(n-k,r) from 2^(n-k) for r=0, 1, 2, results to distinct counting sequences.
